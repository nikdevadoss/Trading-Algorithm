# Trading-Algorithm

I created stock trading algorithm that uses the doji star indicator to buy and sell stocks using Alpaca's Trade API. Currently working on creating an ML algorithm to scan a portfolio of stocks and determine which one to run the algorithm on (scanning for short term growth potential). I have tested this algorithm in real time using paper trading and it yields a positive return of about 1% per trading period, however I have yet to test it over the long term with more aggressive profit margins.
